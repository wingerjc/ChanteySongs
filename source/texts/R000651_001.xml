Whiskey is the life of man.
    _Whiskey_ Johnny,
We'll drink our whiskey when we can:
    _Whiskey_ for my Johnny.

I drink whiskey, and my wife drinks gin,
    Chorus.
And the way she drinks it is a sin,
    Chorus.

I and my wife cannot agree,
    Chorus.
For she drinks whiskey in her tea,
    Chorus.

I had a girl her name was Lize,
    Chorus.
She put whiskey in her pies,
    Chorus.

Whiskey's gone and I'll go too,
    Chorus.
For without whiskey I can't do,
    Chorus.
