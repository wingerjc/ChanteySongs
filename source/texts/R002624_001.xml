I wish I was in Mobile bay,
    _Way, hey,_ knock a man down,
A rolling  cotton night and day,
    _This_ is the time to knock a man down.

I wish I was in New Orleans,
    Chorus.
Where Jackson Gave the British beans,
    Chorus.

I wish I was at Boston city,
    Chorus.
a walking with my lovely Kitty,
    Chorus.

I wish I was in New York Town,
    Chorus.
a walking Broadway up and down,
    Chorus.

I wish I was in Liverpool,
    Chorus.
a going to a Yankee school,
    Chorus.
