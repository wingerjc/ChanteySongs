There's a saucy wild packet, and a packet of fame,
She belongs to New York, and the Dreadnaught's her name.
She is bound to the westward where strong winds do blow,
Bound away in the Dreadnaught, to the westward we go.

The time of her sailing is now drawing nigh;
Farewell pretty May, I must bid you goodbye,
Farewell to old Englang and all there we hold dear,
Bound away in the Dreadnaught, to the westward we'll steer.

Oh, the hauling out of Waterloo dock,
Where the boys and the girls on the pier head do flock;
They will give us three cheers whil ther tears freely flow,
Saying, god bless the Dreadnaught whereso'er she may go.

Oh! the Dreadnaught is waiting in the Mersey so free,
Waiting for the Independence to tow her to sea;
For to round the black rock where the Mersey does flow,
Bound away in the Dreadnaught, to the westward we'll go.

Oh! the Dreadnaught's a'howling down the wild Irish shore,
Captain Samuels commands her as he's oft done before,
While the sailors like lions walk the decks to and fro,
Bound away in the Dreadnaught, to the westward we'll go.

Oh! the Dreadnaught's a'sailing the Atlantic so wide,
Where the dark, heavy seas roll along the black side
With the sails neatly spread, and the red cross to show,
Bound away in the Dreadnaught, to the westward we'll go.

Oh! the Dreadnaught's becalmed on the banks of Newfoundland,
Where the water's so green and the bottom is sand,
Where the fish of the ocean swim round to and fro,
Bound away in the Dreadnaught, to the westward we'll go.

Oh! the Dreadnaught's arrived in America once more,
We'll go ashor shipmates on the land we adore,
See our wives and our sweethearts, be merry and free;
Drink a health to the Dreadnaught whereso'er she may be.

Here's a health to the Dreadnaughtand to all her brave crew,
Here's a health to Capt. Samuels and officers too,
Talk about your flash packets, "Swallow Tail" and "Black Ball,"
But the Dreadnaught's the clipper to beat one and all.
