Hail! Columbia, happy land! Hail! ye heroes, heav'n-born band,
Who fought and bled in freedom's cause, Who fought and bled in freedom's cause,
And when the storm of war was gone, Enjoyed the peace your valor won;
Let independence be your boast, Ever mindful what it cost,
Ever gratefule for the prize, Let its altar reach the skies.

Chorus
Firm, united, let us be, Rallying round our liberty;
As a band of brothers joined, Peace and safety we shall find.

Immortal patriots, rise once more! Defend your rights, defend your shore;
Let no rude foe with impious hand, Let no rude foe with impious hand
Invade the shrine where sacred lies Of toil and blood the well earned prize;
While offering peace sincere and just, In heav'n we place a manly trust,
That truth and justice may prevail, ev'ry scheme of bondage fail.

Sound, sound the trump of fame!
